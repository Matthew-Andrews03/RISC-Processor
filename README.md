README: RISC Processor Implemented in Verilog

Overview
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor. 
The RISC processor is designed to execute a simplified instruction set architecture with a focus on minimizing instruction cycle time and improving performance.

Features
RISC Architecture: The processor follows a RISC architecture, which simplifies instruction decoding and execution.
Multiple Stages: The sequence consists of multiple stages such as instruction fetch, instruction decode, execution, memory access, and write-back.
Control Unit: A dedicated control unit manages the execution flow and control signals within the processor.
ALU Operations: Arithmetic and logic operations are supported by the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
Memory Access: The processor can interact with memory for loading and storing data.
Branching: Branch instructions enable conditional and unconditional branching within the program flow.
Input/Output: Input and output operations allow communication with external devices.

File Structure
control_unit.v: Verilog module defining the control unit functionality.
alu.v: Verilog module implementing the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
ram.v: Verilog module for memory access operations.
datapath.v: Main Verilog module integrating all components to form the RISC processor.
datapath_..._testbench.v: Testbench modules for verifying the functionality of the processor.

Usage
Simulation: Run the provided testbench module (testbench.v) using a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog to simulate the behavior of the RISC processor and verify its functionality.
Synthesis: Synthesize the Verilog code using a synthesis tool compatible with your target FPGA or ASIC platform to generate the hardware implementation of the RISC processor.
